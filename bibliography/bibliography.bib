Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory. Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.}},

  abstract={ The scope of this paper is to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Gini index by providing the original formulae. Corrado Gini introduced his index for the first time in a 1912 book published in Italian under the name of “Variabilità e Mutabilità” (Variability and Mutability). This article provides selected extracts of Part I of the book dedicated to measures of variability. We find that Gini proposed no less than 13 formulations of his index, none of which is known today to the large public. We also find that Gini anticipated some of the developments that derived from the study of his index. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2012},

@article{meijering_09_tracking,
    abstract = {{The past decade has seen an unprecedented data explosion in biology. It has become evident that in order to take full advantage of the potential wealth of information hidden in the data produced by even a single experiment, visual inspection and manual analysis are no longer adequate. To ensure efficiency, consistency, and completeness in data processing and analysis, computational tools are essential. Of particular importance to many modern live-cell imaging experiments is the ability to automatically track and analyze the motion of objects in time-lapse microscopy images. This article surveys the recent literature in this area. Covering all scales of microscopic observation, from cells, down to molecules, and up to entire organisms, it discusses the latest trends and successes in the development and application of computerized tracking methods in cell and developmental biology.}},

@article{sulston_83_embryonic,
    abstract = {{The embryonic cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans has been traced from zygote to newly hatched larva, with the result that the entire cell lineage of this organism is now known. During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.}},

@article{kari_07_zebrafish,
    abstract = {{In vivo studies represent an essential step in drug development and currently rely largely on mice, yet limitations of mammalian models motivated the search for complementary vertebrate model systems. This review focuses on zebrafish, Danio rerio, as a facile model system to study human disease and drug responses. Zebrafish are particularly suited for this purpose because they represent a vertebrate species, their genome is sequenced, and a large number of synchronously developing, transparent embryos can be produced. Zebrafish embryos are permeable to drugs and can easily be manipulated using well-established genetic and molecular approaches. Here, we summarize recent work on drug discovery and toxicity in zebrafish embryos. In addition, we provide a synopsis of current efforts to establish disease models in zebrafish focusing on neoplasia. The results of these studies highlight the potential of zebrafish as a viable addition to established animal models by offering medium and, potentially, high throughput capabilities.}},
