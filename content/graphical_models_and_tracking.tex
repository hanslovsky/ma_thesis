\chapter{Probabilistic Graphical Models}
\label{cha:probabilistic_graphical_models}

In mathematical graph theory a \emph{graph}
\begin{align}
    G &= (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}) \\
    \mathcal{V} &= \{V_1,\hdots ,V_n\}
\end{align}
is defined as an ordered pair of a set $\mathcal{V}$ of \emph{vertices} (also \emph{nodes}) and a
set $\mathcal{E}$ of \emph{edges} (also \emph{arcs} if directed) between pairs of vertices
~\citep[34]{koller_09_probabilistic}. Arcs are directed ($V_i\to V_j$), with an arrow pointing from
parent to child node, representing the direction of the interaction, while edges are undirected
($V_i \textbf{ --- } V_j$). More concisely, this implies structure, which can be exploited for
modeling probability distributions as \emph{probabilistic graphical models}. Here, nodes represent
\emph{random variables} and edges describe their independence/dependence
relationships~\citep[57]{barber_12_bayesian}.

The graphical models as defined in \cref{sec:gm-graphical-models} can be utilized to model
tracking-by-assignment problems as described in \cref{cha:gm-in-tracking,cha:joint}. However, as a
first step, \cref{sec:probability-theory} clarifies basic probabilistic concepts that are used
throughout this thesis and defines an unambiguous notation thereof.
% Closely related to
% this are \emph{factor graphs} that can describe factorized probability distributions and are
% especially useful when it comes to inference, \ie extraction of information from the graphical
% model.

\chapter{Graphical Models and their Application in Cell Tracking}
\label{cha:gm-in-tracking}
Creating cell tracks and lineages from raw data is a demanding task with challenging requirements
described in \cref{cha:introduction}. One way of approaching this task is group the tracking into
two separate objectives, namely first detecting all cells in the data and then find the correct
assignments between them. First, \cref{sec:tracking-by-assignment} shows how the assignment task can
be formulated based on the detection outcome. Then, the probabilistic graphical models introduced in
\cref{cha:probabilistic_graphical_models} are utilized to solve the assignment task and produce a
meaningful tracking result. Furthermore, \cref{cha:GMM} extends the approach presented in
\cref{subsec:fg-conservation}, while \cref{cha:joint} introduces a new tracking method, that blurs
the border between detection and assignment.
