\chapter{Segmentation}
\label{cha:segmentation}

Segmentation is the process of assigning pixels/voxels to foreground or background. In the best
case, each foreground region in the segmentation represents a single object and all background
regions are actual background. Segmentation based on pixel features only without precomputing
superpixels is called pixel classification and is described in more detail in this chapter.
