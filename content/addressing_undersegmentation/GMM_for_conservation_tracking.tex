\chapter{Circumventing Undersegmentation - GMM for Conservation Tracking}
\label{cha:GMM}

While the conservation tracking (\cref{subsec:fg-conservation}) is capable of detecting merged
objects and inferring the number of cells per connected component, the factor graph by itself has no
means for separating merged objects and thus reconstructing lost tracks.  Even with the knowledge of
merged objects, tracks will be lost, including division events. This may, depending on the number of
merged objects in the segmentation, heavily deteriorate the tracking result -- a downgrade that can
be evaded given the knowledge about merged objects.

In order to reconstruct the lost tracks, we introduce a two-step post-processing procedure on the
conservation tracking result depicted in \cref{fig:gmm-pipeline}:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item Reconstruct cells for all connected components that contain more than one cell according
    to the conservation tracking.
      \item Build a hypotheses graph on this subset of cells and rerun the tracking with new
    constraints, ensuring that \label{itm:gmm-new-constraints}
    \begin{enumerate}
          \item all cells are active, and \label{itm:gmm-all-cells-active}
          \item no divisions occur. \label{itm:gmm-no-divisions}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

With evidence about the number of cells per connected component, unsupervised clustering algorithms
are a viable choice for cell reconstruction. The key feature to be reconstructed is the center of
mass for each cell as it is needed for both the creation of the new hypotheses graph and inference
in order to deduct the tracking result, corrected for mergers. More precisely, it is valid to assume
that the ellipsoidal shape of cells can be matched to covariance matrices of Gaussian
distributions. This is in contrast and preferable to the k-means clustering
algorithm\citep{macqueen_67_methods}. Therefore, \emph{Gaussian mixture models} (GMMs) are a viable
choice for such a task, with implementations readily available.

The new constraints which constrict inference on the subset hypotheses graph are a direct result of
the method being a post-processing for conservation tracking: The conservation tracking factor graph
infers the correct number of cells in the respective connected components and conservation of mass
enforces that these numbers are consistent over time. Furthermore, no divisions may, because the
conservation tracking disallows divisions cooccuring with mergers. Reintroducing divisions in the
post-processing method would require deactivating cells, in order to allow for global consistency,
which is vetoed by prerequisite that the number of cells in a connected component is correct.

In the following, we show how Gaussian mixture models can be utilized for cell reconstruction in
\cref{sec:gmm-gmm}, before describing the construction of the new hypotheses graph on the subset
of cells and the inference of the final tracking solution in \cref{sec:gmm-hypotheses}. Finally,
the experiments in \cref{sec:gmm-experiments} show results of the proposed method.
