\section{Graphical Models}
\label{sec:gm-graphical-models}

A graphical representation of probability distributions is helpful for modeling
independence/dependence relationships. Graphical models impose structure that reflects those
relations. However, the capabilities of graphical models is limited and any use case requires the
choice of an appropriate kind of graphical model \citep[57]{barber_12_bayesian}. Of
the many types of graphical models we present Bayesian networks (\cref{subsec:gm-bayesian-net}),
conditional random fields (\cref{subsec:gm-crf}) and factor graphs
(\cref{subsec:factor-graphs}). Both the Bayesian networks and the conditional random fields can be
transformed into a factor graph representation, which is commonly used for inference. Moreover, as
shown in \cref{subsec:fg-conservation} and \cref{cha:joint}, a factor graph can also be utilized for
modeling.

We introduced three probabilistic graphical models, namely Bayesian networks, conditional random
fields and factor graphs. In the following, \cref{cha:gm-in-tracking} shows two examples for
graphical model based tracking-by-assignment methods, \emph{chain graph} tracking in
\cref{subsec:fg-chaingraph} and \emph{conservation} tracking in \cref{subsec:fg-conservation}.
