\section{Tracking as a Factor Graph}
\label{sec:tracking-as-a-factor-graph}
The tracking-by-assignment problem can be solved using probabilistic graphical models. For that
purpose, random variables for the assignments and detections are introduced, thus imposing
uncertainty. These random variables are used to construct a graphical model from the tracking
hypotheses whose specific form is a design choice of the tracking approach. The optimal solution is
then deduced by performing inference on the graphical model. In general, it is reasonable to
transfer the graphical model into a factor graph before inference, if not already formulated as a
factor graph directly.

In the following, two approaches are described, that utilize the power of probabilistic graphical
models, namely \emph{chain graph} tracking in \cref{subsec:fg-chaingraph} and \emph{conservation}
tracking in \cref{subsec:fg-conservation}. While the chain graph approach uses a \emph{chain graph},
\ie a graphical model with both directed and undirected edges
(\citealp[Chapter~4.1.5]{kausler_13_tracking};
\citealp[Chapter~4.6.2]{koller_09_probabilistic},
\citealp{frydenberg_90_chain}), for modeling and a factor graph for inference, the
conservation tracking models a factor graph directly.
